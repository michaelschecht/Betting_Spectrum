- Added **Precious Metals** as the 11th category (gold `#fbbf24` color, on by default)
- **Gold:** Gold Bullion / GLD (+7.5%), Gold Mining Stocks / GDX (+5.0%), Junior Mining Stocks / GDXJ (+1.0%)

- **Precious Coins (Numismatic)** moved from Collectibles → Precious Metals

### Category & UI Updates

---

## V16 / edge_analysis11.md — March 27, 2026

### Streamlined Dataset (180 → 155 entries)
- **Removed Options & Derivatives** (14 entries) — specialized instruments with extreme outliers not relevant to typical investors/gamblers
- **Removed Active Trading** (10 entries) — niche category with extreme negative returns that overlapped with existing stock market entries
- **Removed Poker Elite Pro** (1 entry) — unrealistic returns at 8% edge / 30 DU/day / 5% CED
- **10 categories** remain: Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Crypto, Collectibles, Sports, Casino, Poker/DFS, Predictions, Lottery

### Default Category Selection
- **8 categories on by default:** Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Crypto, Collectibles, Sports, Predictions, Lottery
- **Casino and Poker/DFS off by default** — available via dropdown toggle but excluded initially to avoid extreme outliers dominating the chart
- "All Categories" toggle in dropdown still selects/deselects everything

### Adaptive Y-Axis Scaling
- Replaced absolute min/max range with **5th–95th percentile** range + 15% padding
- Mid-range data (near 0%) is always visible and fills the screen
- Outlier bars extend beyond the visible area instead of squishing everything else flat
- Minimum guaranteed range of -5% to +5% so the chart never collapses on narrow data

### Adaptive Tick Formatting
- Y-axis tick interval and decimal places now scale with data range
- Short horizons (1 Decision, 1 Day): 0.1% ticks with 2 decimal places — makes tiny differences between bars clearly visible
- Medium horizons (1 Week, 1 Month): 0.2–1% ticks with 1 decimal place
- Long horizons (1 Year+): 5–20% ticks with integer formatting
- Chart fills the screen at every time horizon

---

## V15 / edge_analysis10.md — March 27, 2026

### Standardized DU/CED Framework
- **Replaced hardcoded gambling model** (`N × 0.10 × edge`) with per-activity **DU/CED framework** (`DU_period × CED × edge`)
- **DU/day** (Decision Units per day) — realistic frequency for each activity (e.g., slots=500, sports spread=2, Powerball=0.1)
- **CED** (Capital Exposure per Decision) — % of bankroll risked per decision (e.g., slots=0.5%, blackjack=2%, poker pro=5%)
- Activities are now differentiated by behavior: high-frequency/small-bet (slots) vs low-frequency/large-bet (futures)
- **Compound model unchanged** — investing categories still use `((1+a/100)^years - 1) × 100` with DU/day=1, CED=100%
- Tooltip now shows DU/day and CED for gambling entries
- New data file: `Data/edge_analysis10.md` with all 180 entries computed under the DU/CED framework

---

## V14 / edge_analysis8.md — March 27, 2026

### Time Horizon Overhaul (5 → 7 Horizons)
- **Fixed misaligned mappings:** Old model mapped "1 Bet" to "1 Month" of investing and "25 Bets / 1 Day" to "2 Years" — these made no sense
- **7 calendar-anchored horizons:** 1 Bet, 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 1 Year, 5 Years, 10 Years
- **Added 1 Week and 1 Month** — fills the gap between single event and full year
- **Investing model:** Compound returns over calendar time (1 trade = 1/252 yr, 1 day = 1/252, 1 wk = 1/52, 1 mo = 1/12, 1 yr = 1, 5 yr = 5, 10 yr = 10)
- **Gambling model:** Events pro-rated from 625/year baseline — 1 bet = 1, 1 day = 2, 1 wk = 12, 1 mo = 52, 1 yr = 625, 5 yr = 3,125, 10 yr = 6,250
- All event counts are **monotonically increasing** across horizons
- Compact button labels: "1 Bet", "1 Day", "1 Week", "1 Month", "1 Year", "5 Years", "10 Years"
- DCA amounts updated for 7 horizons ($100 for short periods, scaling to $52K at 10 years)

### New Data File
- `Data/edge_analysis8.md` — Documents the time horizon overhaul with old-vs-new comparison tables

---

## V13 / edge_analysis7.md — March 27, 2026

### Mobile Responsive Design
- Full responsive layout via `@media (max-width: 768px)` and `@media (max-width: 380px)` — no separate mobile version
- **Header:** Stacks vertically, subtitle hidden, legend floats right
- **Controls bar:** Multi-row wrap layout; separators hidden; labels span full width as section headers; time buttons in horizontal scroll container
- **Metric bar:** Compact spacing, long values truncated with ellipsis, verbose label hidden on mobile
- **Tooltip → bottom drawer:** Fixed to bottom of screen with rounded top corners, full width, scrollable content, drag-handle pill at top. Uses `pointer-events:auto` so users can scroll within. Dismissed by tapping outside
- **Chart:** Fixed height (55vh / 50vh on very small screens) instead of flex, tighter margins, hidden annotations and y-axis title
- **Interaction model:** `plotly_click` on mobile (tap a bar to see details) vs `plotly_hover` on desktop. Click anywhere outside drawer to dismiss
- **Extra-small screens (< 380px):** Further reduced button/font sizes, smaller chart viewport
- **Footer:** Smaller text, extra padding for readability

---

## V12 / edge_analysis7.md — March 27, 2026

### Design Refresh: Modern Zinc-Based Dark Theme
- **New color palette:** Shifted from navy-blue base (#080c14) to neutral zinc (#09090b) for a cleaner, more modern look
- **Border treatment:** Replaced hard hex borders with `rgba(255,255,255,...)` at varying opacities — subtle and cohesive
- **Typography:** Added Inter font preference, tighter letter-spacing on headings, refined font weight hierarchy
- **Controls:** Softer button styles using translucent white fills/borders; active states use tinted color washes instead of solid backgrounds
- **Tooltip:** Frosted glass effect (`backdrop-filter:blur(20px)`), refined spacing (18px padding), indigo accent on active horizon
- **Chart:** Grid lines and zero line use rgba for consistency; softer annotation colors
- **Metric bar:** Lighter treatment with updated zinc-scale text colors

### Favicon
- Inline SVG favicon: four bars (green → yellow → red) crossing a center line — represents the edge spectrum concept
- Self-contained as a data URI, no external file dependency

### Multi-Select Categories (from V11 fix)
- Category dropdown now supports **multi-select** — toggle any combination of categories
- "All Categories" acts as select-all / deselect-all toggle
- Button label shows: "All Categories", up to 2 names, or "N Categories" count
- Dropdown stays open for multiple selections
